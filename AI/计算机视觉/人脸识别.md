# 人脸识别

实现one shot learning

## Siamese network

使用一个卷积神经网络来对图片进行编码，比较图片编码的差异来判别图片是否为同一人

### 损失函数

使用三元组(A,P,N)来计算损失

- A

  样例图片

- P

  和A为同一人的图片

- N

  和A为不同人的图片

$$
L(A,P,N)=max(d(A,P)-d(A,N)+\alpha,0)\\
d(x,y)=||x-y||^2
$$



- $\alpha$为了使f不总是输出0
- 又$d(A,P)\le d(A,N)即d(A,P)-d(A,N)\le0$，顾取max 0
